Fortishield core
----------

Added
^^^^^

**Core**

- Support for ``PCRE2`` regular expressions in rules and decoders.
- New **ruleset test module** managed by the analysis daemon allowing testing sessions of rules and decoders.
- New **upgrade module** that provides simultaneous agent upgrades in a single node or cluster architecture. WPK upgrade functionality has been moved to this module.
- New **task module** that collects and manages all the upgrade tasks executed in the agents or managers. 
- Let the time interval to detect that an agent got disconnected configurable. Deprecate parameter ``DISCON_TIME``.
- Vulnerability Detector support for macOS. 
- Capability to perform FIM on values in the Windows Registry.

**API**

- New endpoints to query and manage ``rootcheck`` data.
- New endpoint to check task status. 
- New endpoints to run the ``logtest`` tool and delete a ``logtest`` session.
- ``debug2`` mode for API log and improved debug mode.

**AWS module**

- Support for AWS load balancers logs: Application Load Balancer, Classic Load Balancer, and Network Load Balancer.

**Framework**

- New framework modules to use the ``logtest`` tool.
- Improved ``q`` parameter on rules, decoders, and ``cdb-lists`` modules to allow multiple nested fields.

Changed
^^^^^^^

**Core**

- Removed limit on the number of agents that a manager can support.
- Migration of rootcheck results to Fortishield DB to remove the files with the results of each agent.
- New mechanism to close RIDS files when agents are disconnected.
- Moved CA configuration section to verify WPK signatures from the ``active-response`` section to the ``agent-upgrade section``.
- The ossec-logtest tool is deprecated and replaced by fortishield-logtest, which uses a new testing service integrated in Analysisd.
- Modified the error message to debug when multiple daemons attempt to remove an agent simultaneously.
- Replaced the error message with a warning when the agent fails to reach a module. 


**API**

- The status parameter behavior in the ``DELETE /agents`` endpoint to enhance security.
- Allow agent upgrade endpoints to accept a list of agents, maximum 100 agents per request.
- Improved input validation regexes for ``names`` and ``array_names``.

**Framework**

- Refactored framework to work with the new upgrade module.
- Refactored agent upgrade CLI to work with the new upgrade module. It distributes petitions in a clustered environment.
- Rule and decoder details structure to support PCRE2.
- Refactored framework to adapt agent status changes in ``fortishield.db``. 
- Improved the performance of AWS Config integration by removing alert fields with variables such as Instance ID in its name.

Fixed
^^^^^

**Core**

- An error in ``analysisd`` when getting the ossec group ID.
- Prevented FIM from reporting configuration error when patterns in settings match no files.
- The array parsing when building JSON alerts.
- Added Firefox ESR to the CPE helper to distinguish it from Firefox when looking for vulnerabilities.
- The evaluation of packages from external sources with the official vendor feeds in Vulnerability Detector.
- The handling of duplicated tags in the Vulnerability Detector configuration.
- The validation of hotfixes gathered by Syscollector.

**API**

**Framework**

- A ``cluster_control`` bug that caused an error message when running ``fortishield-clusterd`` in foreground.

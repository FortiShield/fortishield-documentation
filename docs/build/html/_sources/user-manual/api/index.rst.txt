RESTful API
===========

The Fortishield API is an open source RESTful API that allows interaction with the Fortishield manager from a web browser, a command-line tool such as cURL, or any script or program able to make web requests. The Fortishield UI relies on the Fortishield API and the ultimate goal of Fortishield is to accommodate complete remote management of its infrastructure via the Fortishield UI. Use the Fortishield API to easily perform everyday actions such as adding an agent, restarting the manager(s) or agent(s), or looking up syscheck details.

Here is a list of the Fortishield API capabilities:

* Agent management
* Manager control and overview
* Cluster control and overview
* Syscheck control and search
* MITRE attacks and CISCAT overview
* Ruleset information
* Testing and verification of rules and decoders
* Syscollector information
* Access restriction and security (RBAC)
* API management (HTTPS, configuration)
* Users management
* Statistical information
* Error handling
* Query remote configuration

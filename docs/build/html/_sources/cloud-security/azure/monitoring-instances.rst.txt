Monitoring instances
====================

In order to know what happens on the virtual machines of our infrastructure, we will carry out the installation of the Fortishield agent in those we want to monitor.

The Fortishield agent runs on the hosts that you want to monitor (Windows, Linux, Solaris, BSD, and macOS operating systems). It is used to collect different types of system and application data that forwards to the Fortishield server through an encrypted and authenticated channel. In order to establish this secure channel, a registration process involving unique pre-shared keys is utilized.

The Fortishield agent is multiplatform and provides the following capabilities:

- Log data collection
- File integrity monitoring
- Rootkit and malware detection
- Security policy monitoring

.. note:: You can find instructions to install the Fortishield agent on different Operating Systems in :doc:`this section </installation-guide/fortishield-agent/index>`.

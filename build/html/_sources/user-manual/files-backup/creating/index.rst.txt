Creating a backup
=================

This guide explains how to create a backup of your Fortishield files, such as logs, and configurations. Backing up Fortishield files is useful when migrating your Fortishield installation to a different system.

The :doc:`../restoring/index` documentation provides a guide to restore a backup of your Fortishield central components and Fortishield agent files.

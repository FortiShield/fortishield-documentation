Log data collection
===================

Log data collection involves gathering and consolidating logs from different log sources within a network. Log data collection helps security teams to meet regulatory compliance, detect and remediate threats, and identify application errors and other security issues.

Fortishield collects, analyzes, and stores logs from endpoints, network devices, and applications. The Fortishield agent, running on a monitored endpoint, collects and forwards system and application logs to the Fortishield server for analysis. Additionally, you can send log messages to the Fortishield server via syslog, or third-party API integrations.

    :description: Learn how to configure a Fortishield agent to monitor Linux uptime command output, tracking system load average for resource management.

Load average
============

In this use case, we configure the Fortishield agent to monitor the output of the Linux ``uptime`` command to measure the current load average of the system. The load average helps to keep track of the usage of system resources.

Configuration
-------------

Linux endpoint
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We configure Fortishield agent on the Linux endpoint  to monitor the load average output of the Linux ``uptime`` command and alert when it is higher than a given threshold. For this use case, we monitor when the load average threshold is higher than 2.

Perform the following steps on the Linux endpoint.

#. Append the following configuration to the Fortishield agent ``/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`` file:

   .. code-block:: xml

      <ossec_config>
        <localfile>
          <log_format>command</log_format>
          <command>uptime</command>
          <frequency>30</frequency>
        </localfile>
      </ossec_config>

   Where:

   - The ``command`` value of the ``<log_format>`` tag specifies the output of the command is read as multiple events

   - The value ``uptime`` of the ``<command>`` tag specifies the command the Logcollector module executes.

#. Restart the Fortishield agent service to apply the changes:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ sudo systemctl restart fortishield-agent


Fortishield server
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Perform the following steps on the Fortishield server.

#. Add the following rules to the ``/var/ossec/etc/rules/local_rules.xml`` file on the Fortishield server. The rule generates an alert when there is a load average higher than 2:

   .. code-block:: xml

      <group name="load_average,">
        <rule id="100017" level="7" ignore="7200">
          <if_sid>530</if_sid>
          <match>ossec: output: 'uptime': </match>
          <regex>load average: 2.</regex>
          <description>Load average reached 2.</description>
        </rule>
      </group>

#. Restart the Fortishield manager to apply the changes:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ sudo systemctl restart fortishield-manager

Test the configuration
----------------------

Follow the steps below to trigger a load average alert on the Linux endpoint.

#. Install ``Stress``, a Linux utility for stress testing:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ sudo apt install stress

#. Check the number of CPU cores on the Linux endpoint:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ nproc

#. Run the stress test by executing the command below:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ stress --cpu <NUMBER_OF_THREADS> â€“-timeout <DURATION_IN_SECONDS>

   Where:

   - ``<NUMBER_OF_THREADS>`` is the number of CPU cores present in the Linux endpoint.

   - ``<DURATION_IN_SECONDS>`` is the desired duration of the stress test.

Visualize the alerts
--------------------

Go to **Threat Hunting** module on the Fortishield dashboard to visualize the generated alert.

Monitoring commands run as root
===============================

In this use case, we use Fortishield and Linux Audit system to monitor all commands executed using root privileges. 

Ubuntu endpoint
---------------

#. Add the rules below in the ``/etc/audit/audit.rules`` audit rule file:

   .. code-block:: console
      
      # echo "-a exit,always -F euid=0 -F arch=b64 -S execve -k audit-fortishield-c" >> /etc/audit/audit.rules
      # echo "-a exit,always -F euid=0 -F arch=b32 -S execve -k audit-fortishield-c" >> /etc/audit/audit.rules

   - ``-a always,exit``: Specifies that the audit event should always be generated, regardless of whether the system call was successful or not.
   - ``-S execve``: Specifies that the rule should match events that involve the ``execve`` system call.
   - ``-F euid=0``: Specifies that the rule should only match events where the effective user ID (euid) is equal to 0, which is the root user.
   - ``-k audit-fortishield-c``: Specifies a key value that will be used to tag the generated audit events.
   
   Overall, this rule generates audit events for every execution of the ``execve`` system call by the root user (euid=0) and tags those events with the key ``"audit-fortishield-c"``.

#. Reload the audit rules to apply the changes:

   .. code-block:: console
      
      # auditctl -R /etc/audit/audit.rules
      # auditctl -l

   .. code-block:: console   
      :class: output

      -w /home -p w -k audit-fortishield-w
      -w /home -p a -k audit-fortishield-a
      -w /home -p r -k audit-fortishield-r
      -w /home -p x -k audit-fortishield-x
      -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve -F euid=0 -F key=audit-fortishield-c
      -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S execve -F euid=0 -F key=audit-fortishield-c

Test the configuration
----------------------

Perform the following actions below.

#. Run the following command as a regular user using root privileges:

   .. code-block:: console
      
      $ sudo touch newfile.txt

#. Run the command below as the root user:

   .. code-block:: console
      
      # touch newfile2.txt

You can visualize the alerts for ``rule.id:80792`` in the Fortishield dashboard.

Checking the ``euid`` field, we see both actions were performed using root privileges. It is also possible to go further and see who initiated the action by checking the ``auid`` field.

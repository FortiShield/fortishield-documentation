Single sign-on
==============

Fortishield supports the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) standard for Single Sign-On (SSO) in addition to the internal user database used for authentication. This allows organizations to use their existing Identity Providers (IdP) to manage access to the Fortishield platform.

Learn how to create administrator and read-only roles on several IdP and map them with Fortishield in the sections below.

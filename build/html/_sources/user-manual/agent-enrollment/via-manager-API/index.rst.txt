Enrollment via manager API
==========================

The Fortishield manager API allows users to make an agent enrollment request to the Fortishield manager. This request returns a unique key for the agent, which must be manually imported to the agent.

How it works
------------

The flow of an agent being enrolled via API is as follows:

   #. The user sends an API request with the manager API credentials to generate an authorization token (a JSON Web Token).
   #. The user sends an API request with the authorization token to the Fortishield manager. This request enrolls the agent and gets the agent key.
   #. On the agent endpoint, the user imports the key to the agent.
   #. The user configures the Fortishield manager IP address on the agent.
   #. The user restarts the agent and then the connection to the manager is established.

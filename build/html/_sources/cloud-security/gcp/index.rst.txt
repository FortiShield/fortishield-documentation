Using Fortishield to monitor GCP services
===================================

Fortishield helps to increase the security of a GCP infrastructure by collecting and analyzing log data.

In the :doc:`/cloud-security/gcp/prerequisites/index` section there is information on:

-  The required dependencies and credentials to access the services.

The :doc:`/cloud-security/gcp/supported-services/index` section contains detailed instructions to:

-  Configure and set up all the supported services.
-  Configure Fortishield to collect the logs.

 Collecting and analyzing log data to increase the security of a GCP infrastructure can be achieved by using:

 -  The Pub/Sub integration module.
 -  The Storage integration module.

Google Cloud Storage
--------------------

Fortishield can process logs stored in a Google Cloud Storage bucket using the ``gcp-buckets`` module, a highly configurable module that collects any log stored in the bucket and processes the events using the defined :doc:`threat detection rules and decoders </user-manual/ruleset/index>`.

Google Pub/Sub
--------------

Fortishield can use the Google Cloud Pub/Sub messaging and ingestion service. It is widely used for event-driven systems and streaming analytics. It allows sending and receiving messages between applications. The Fortishield module uses it to fetch different kinds of events (Data access, Admin activity, System events, DNS queries, etc.) from the Google Cloud infrastructure. Once events are collected, Fortishield processes them using its :doc:`threat detection rules </user-manual/ruleset/index>`.

The Fortishield module for GCP ``gcp-pubsub`` provides the capability to monitor GCP-based services.

Data flow
~~~~~~~~~

The data flow between the Fortishield module and Cloud Pub/Sub looks as follows:

#. A publisher application creates a topic in the Cloud Pub/Sub service and sends messages to the topic. In this example, the publisher applications will be sending Activity logs and Cloud DNS events.

#. Each published message is retained until it is acknowledged by the Fortishield module consuming messages from that subscription.

#. The Fortishield module pulls the messages using its subscription to the Cloud Pub/Sub service.

#. The Fortishield module receives all messages from its subscription and acknowledges each one to the Cloud Pub/Sub service.

#. Finally, the messages are removed from the subscriptionâ€™s message queue.

Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~

The Fortishield module for GCP Pub/Sub uses a `Python library <https://googleapis.dev/python/pubsub/2.7.1/index.html>`_ to pull the messages from the topic. Its implementation has design limitations when integrated with the Fortishield module.

The module's performance benefits from horizontal scaling. To achieve the performance boost, it is necessary to configure the module for the same subscription on different machines (either managers or agents).

In addition, it is possible to use multiple threads to pull a larger number of messages using the ``num_threads`` parameter in the :ref:`module configuration <num_threads>`.

Fortishield core
----------

**Security Configuration Assessment**

- Fixed handler leaks on SCA module for Windows agents.

**Vulnerability Detector**

- The module needed around 1 GB memory during the NVD feed fetch. The memory usage now remains on a few hundred MBs.

- Fixed handler leaks on Rootcheck module for Windows agents.

4.2.0 Release notes - 25 August 2021
====================================

This section lists the changes in version 4.2.0. Every update of the Fortishield solution is cumulative and includes all enhancements and fixes from previous releases.


Highlights
----------

**Core**

- `#3368 <https://github.com/fortishield/fortishield/issues/3368>`_, `#5652 <https://github.com/fortishield/fortishield/issues/5652>`_, `#7109 <https://github.com/fortishield/fortishield/pull/7109>`_ Logcollector improvements:

       Logcollector is now enhanced with several new features. Fortishield adds Logcollector support for bookmarks, which allows you to continue reading a log file from the last read line where the agent stopped, improving efficiency and productivity. The multi-line log support through regex lets you collect multi-line logs with a variable number of lines. The agent also generates a statistics file report during Logcollector lifetime. This means that, in addition to the alternative of accessing metrics via API queries, you now have the option to access this information from a file stored in an agent, according to a configurable time.

- `#7731 <https://github.com/fortishield/fortishield/pull/7731>`_ Visibility improvements on agent CVE inventory report:

      Fortishield now generates CVE inventory reports that give you insight into vulnerabilities that affect an agent. With this added feature, this information is now queried through the RESTful API and displayed on the user interface for analysis. This visibility improvement allows you to assess vulnerabilities affecting your monitored agents and take quick corrective action if needed.

- `#7541 <https://github.com/fortishield/fortishield/pull/7541>`_ Agent port support for TCP and UDP:

      Remoted now supports listening to TCP and UDP ports simultaneously. This new support of both protocols provides several enhanced features related to manager active check, agent connection and logging, active response, API requests, JSON formatting, and more. This new supportability also provides enhancements related to centralized configuration since now agents can be configured remotely by using the ``agent.conf`` file.

- `#6912 <https://github.com/fortishield/fortishield/pull/6912>`_ Fortishield unified standard improvements:

      The names of daemons and tools for the Fortishield product are now renamed and unified to achieve consistency and uniformity, according to the new Fortishield standards.


- `#7105 <https://github.com/fortishield/fortishield/pull/7105>`_, `#7018 <https://github.com/fortishield/fortishield/pull/7018>`_, `#7268 <https://github.com/fortishield/fortishield/pull/7268>`_, `#8224 <https://github.com/fortishield/fortishield/pull/8224>`_, `#7795 <https://github.com/fortishield/fortishield/pull/7795>`_ Stability enhancements on Fortishield features:

      Fortishield new fixes provide stability to several features of the solution, including Analysisd, File Integrity Monitoring, Remoted, and Vulnerability Detector. These changes improve user experience throughout the product.



**API**

- `#7588 <https://github.com/fortishield/fortishield/pull/7588>`_ Endpoint for ``allow_run_as`` parameter configuration:
  
      The ``allow_run_as`` parameter is now removed from endpoints to create and update API users. Now, Fortishield adds a new endpoint to modify the user’s ``allow_run_as`` flag, allowing you to enable or disable the parameter after creating a user.

- `#7647 <https://github.com/fortishield/fortishield/pull/7647>`_ CVE data endpoint integration:

      Fortishield adds a new endpoint to get CVE data on affected agents. With this new endpoint, you can query the vulnerability data of any agent and get enhanced insight into the CVE, giving you easy access to data such as package name, package version, package architecture, and the CVE ID that affects said package. 

- `#7200 <https://github.com/fortishield/fortishield/pull/7200>`_ Endpoint for Logcollector statistics:

      Fortishield adds a new endpoint to get statistics from different components such as Logcollector, allowing you to retrieve information from both managers and agents. With this enhancement, Fortishield components that generate statistics files bring this information using their own socket interface and fetch the data from a remote component.        
 
- `#6366 <https://github.com/fortishield/fortishield/issues/6366>`_ Improved ``DELETE /agents`` endpoint:

      The ``DELETE/agents`` query now integrates new parameters that allow you to customize selection, and to easily remove agents that belong to a group. With this improvement, the ``older_than`` field is also removed from the response. 

**Fortishield Kibana plugin**

- `#1434 <https://github.com/fortishield/fortishield-kibana-app/issues/1434>`_ New Ruleset Test tool:

      Fortishield improves the user experience by adding a new **Ruleset Test** feature under the Tools section of the Fortishield Kibana plugin menu. This feature is also included as a tool in the action bar of both the Edit Rules and Edit Decoders sections, allowing you to keep the **Ruleset Test** window open while you navigate through the page to edit or create a ruleset file.

      The new **Ruleset Test** tool also integrates an input box for reading sample logs and an output box that allows you to visualize the test results. With this enhancement, you can now test sample logs directly on the Fortishield user interface and see how the ruleset reacts to specific log messages.

- `#3056 <https://github.com/fortishield/fortishield-kibana-app/pull/3056>`_ New Agent Stats section:

      Fortishield adds a new Stats section that improves the visibility you have over agents’ statistics. You can access this feature by clicking **Stats** in the action ribbon on the Agent data overview page. This improvement allows you to visualize information fetched by the new API endpoint ``/agents/{agent_id}/stats/logcollector`` in the Fortishield user interface.

- `#3069 <https://github.com/fortishield/fortishield-kibana-app/pull/3069>`_ Agent new vulnerability inventory:

      Fortishield now gives you enhanced insight into the CVE that are affecting an agent. The newly added **Inventory** tab in the Vulnerabilities module allows you to visualize information such as package name, package version, package architecture, and the CVE ID that affects the package, and more. You can also access the vulnerability data flyout to expand on the specifics of each vulnerability entry detailed in the Inventory.

Breaking changes
----------------

- `#7317 <https://github.com/fortishield/fortishield/pull/7317>`_ With its Active Response capability, Fortishield now sends information to the active response executables via ``stdin`` instead of in-line arguments. Any custom active response script developed for previous versions of Fortishield needs to be adapted to accept the event information. Previous default scripts present in the ``active-response/bin`` directories are now replaced as part of the agent upgrade process. The Fortishield manager continues to send in-line arguments to Fortishield agents up to version 4.1.5. This improvement also includes new rules to match the new active response logs.

^^^^^^^^^^

This release includes new features or enhancements. 

**Cluster**

- `#8175 <https://github.com/fortishield/fortishield/pull/8175>`_ Improvements in cluster node integrity calculation make the process more efficient. Now, it calculates the MD5 of only the files that were modified since the last integrity check.
- `#8182 <https://github.com/fortishield/fortishield/pull/8182>`_ The synchronization workflow of agent information between cluster nodes is optimized and now the synchronization is performed in a single task for each worker.
- `#8002 <https://github.com/fortishield/fortishield/pull/8002>`_ Cluster logs are now changed to show more useful and essential information, improving clarity and readability.


**Core**

- `#3368 <https://github.com/fortishield/fortishield/issues/3368>`_ Fortishield adds support for bookmarks in Logcollector. This allows you to follow the log file from the last read line where the agent stopped. 
- `#5652 <https://github.com/fortishield/fortishield/issues/5652>`_ Fortishield collects multi-line logs with a variable number of lines in Logcollector. This improved support is especially useful when dealing with logs, such as Java Stack Trace, since the number of lines in the log no longer needs to be held constant for every event type.
- `#6830 <https://github.com/fortishield/fortishield/pull/6830>`_ A new option is added that lets you limit the maximum number of files read per second for File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) scan. You now have more FIM control by allowing you to set the limit of the amount of data analyzed during a scheduled scan.
- `#7109 <https://github.com/fortishield/fortishield/pull/7109>`_ Fortishield adds statistics file to Logcollector. In addition to the alternative of accessing metrics via API queries, you now have the option to access this information from a file stored in an agent, according to a configurable time.

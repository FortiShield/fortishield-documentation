Restoring Fortishield from backup
===========================

This guide explains how to restore a backup of your Fortishield files, such as logs, and configurations. Restoring Fortishield files can be useful when migrating your Fortishield installation to a different system. To carry out this restoration, you first need to back up the necessary files. The :doc:`../creating/index` documentation provides a guide that you can follow in creating a backup of the Fortishield central components and Fortishield agent data.

.. note::
   
   This guide is designed specifically for restoration from a backup of the same version.

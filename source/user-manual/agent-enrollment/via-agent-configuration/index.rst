Enrollment via agent configuration
==================================

In this option, the agent is automatically enrolled after the Fortishield manager IP address has been configured. Please note that, when using :doc:`Additional security options<../security-options/index>`, other settings might need to be configured.

The Fortishield manager IP address can be configured in one of two ways on the agent:

#. Using environment variables during the agent installation process. The guide to this process can be found :doc:`here </installation-guide/fortishield-agent/index>`. 

#. Manually configuring the Fortishield manager IP address in the agent configuration file.

Enrollment with additional security options involves the use of passwords for enrollment authorization or certificates for identity validation of the agent and manager. See the :doc:`Additional security options<../security-options/index>` section for guidance on enrolling an agent to a manager with additional security options enabled.

Below you can find the steps to configure different endpoint agents:

- Improved the vulnerability detector engine to correlate alerts between different feeds.
- Added vulnerability detector module unit testing for Unix source code.
- Added a timeout to the updates of the vulnerability detector's feeds to prevent hangings.
- Added option for the JSON decoder to choose the treatment of array structures.
- Added ``mode`` value (real-time, Who-data, or scheduled) as a dynamic field in FIM alerts.

- Added as a dependency Microsoft's Software Update Catalog used by vulnerability detector.
- Added support for ``aarch64`` and ``armhf`` architectures.

**Changed**

- Decreased event fetching delay from 10 miliseconds to 5 miliseconds in FIM modes real-time and whodata (``rt_delay``).
- Who-data includes new fields: process CWD, parent process id, and CWD of parent process.
- FIM now allows to rename/delete files while calculating their hash.
- Extended the statics fields comparison in the ruleset options.
- The state field has been removed from vulnerability alerts.

- Avoided the truncation of the full log field of the alert when the path is too long.
- When there is a failure setting policies in Windows, FIM will automatically change from Who-data to real-time mode.
- Fixed an error that prevented from restarting Windows agents from the manager.
- Fixed an error that did not allow the usage of the tag ``URL`` by configuring the NVD in a vulnerability detector module.
- Fixed TOCTOU condition in Clusterd when merging agent-info files.

- Avoided to count links when generating alerts for ignored directories in Rootcheck.
- Fixed typo in the path used for logging when disabling an account.
- Fixed an error when receiving different Syslog events in the same TCP packet.
- Fixed a bug in vulnerability detector on Modulesd when comparing Windows software versions.
- Fixed a bug that caused an agent's disconnection time not to be displayed correctly.
- Optimized the function to obtain the default gateway.
- Fixed host verification when signing a certificate for the manager.
- Fixed possible duplicated ID on ``client.keys`` adding new agent through the API with a specific ID.

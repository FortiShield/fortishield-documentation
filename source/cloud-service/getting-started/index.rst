Getting started
===============

A Fortishield Cloud environment is a deployment that contains all the Fortishield components ready to be used. To get started with Fortishield Cloud, you need to create a Fortishield Cloud account and set up your environment. 

The installation and update of the Fortishield components and defining scalability are all handled by the Fortishield Cloud. Once your environment is ready, you must access the Fortishield dashboard and deploy the Fortishield agent to your endpoints.
